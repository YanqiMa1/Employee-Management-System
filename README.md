# Employee-Management-System
## Main goal
This Application is designed to enable administrators to manage the number and information of employees working on the site and remotely, and to adjust payroll based on employee motivation.

## Abstract
The project focuses on managing telecommuting and employee mobility during the ongoing epidemic. 
To achieve this, I utilized JavaFX and scene builder to design a user-friendly interface for administrators to login, access the home page, add new employees, and manage employee salaries across four pages. Regarding the login screen, the administrator must have the correct username and password to access it. Regarding the home page, we have total employees, total online employees and total inactive employees for comparison, and a bar chart showing how long each employee has been with the system. For the Add Employee page, we have set five buttons to import, add, update, delete and clear to facilitate the function. For the Employee Salary page, we can change the salary by selecting any row and clicking the Update and Clear buttons. Finally we can go back to the home page and see the corresponding changes by the total number of people, the total number of people online and the total number of people inactive.
All the employee information is stored in a MySQL database, which allows for easy retrieval and management of the data. To implement the back-end functionality, we have made use of class definitions, collections, polymorphism, interfaces, and generics in Java, which are essential tools for building robust and scalable software applications. By incorporating these key programming concepts, we have been able to create a reliable and efficient system that can effectively manage employee information and payroll, even in the face of the challenges posed by the ongoing epidemic.
